# wintime

A "Linux-time"-like program for Windows platform.

Programers on Linux or Mac OS X often use the command `time` to measure the wall time of a program. However, such a stuff does not seem to exist for Windows. This tool is trying to fill the gap. You can simply use it as 
```
wintime program arguments
``` 
(No matter program is just a console one or has GUI). When program is finished, the relevant timings will be reported.
